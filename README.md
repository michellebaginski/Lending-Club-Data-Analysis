# Lending-Club-Data-Analysis

Attached are two python files and the download to the dataset. One contains regression and the other contains classification code. 
You must run both files for the complete project. 
Put these in the same notebook with the dataset and run from the beginning in order.
When you download the dataset, you need to delete the first row and the very last 2 rows because they are useless text and will ruin the format and cause an error while running.
